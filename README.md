# UtilityCraft - Extra Content
A repository for every extra content that Kauziin and Jr. Ice makes for Utility Craft, by Dorios Studios.

[Main Repository](https://github.com/RealMilo504/UtilityCraft)

[UtilityCraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft-bedrock/addons/utilitycraft), made by [@DoriosStudios](https://github.com/DoriosStudios), is an add-on on CurseForge that adds a bunch of new content, as well as improves existent content. This repo is meant to be a "pre-alpha content" storage, keeping content such as "non-approved", "denied" and "deprecated" ideas and parts of the add-on.

Made for convenience and confidenciability purposes.
