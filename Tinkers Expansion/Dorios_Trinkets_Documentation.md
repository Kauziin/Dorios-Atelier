# Dorios' Trinkets — Documentation (Compact, implementable)

**Context & references:** This document documents small-to-medium trinkets intended for the Dorios' Trinkets pack (Bedrock). It follows conventions used by existing trinket/artifact packs such as *Rings & Relics* and various *Artifacts* add-ons for Bedrock/Java as reference design and loot-placement inspiration. See examples: Rings & Relics (CurseForge) and Artifacts Add-On ports. citeturn0search0turn0search2turn0search1

**From Kauziin:** Basically all of this document was generated by AI. I've made a few appearances where I felt it was appropriate, but keep in mind that essentially all of the artifacts (except for the first 6) were created by AI. If you see any absurd suggestion, ignore it. Implementation notes are made for AI functionalities. All personal notes were made by me.

## Usage notes (quick)
- **Slots:** Items are assumed to be equipped into accessory/trinket slots or specific slots (hat, ring, amulet). If your add-on lacks extra slots, items can be activated from inventory or by using the item.  
- **Rarity:** Suggested rarities help placement in loot tables. Adjust as needed.  
- **Balance:** Most "minor" trinkets are designed to be *small bonuses with no tradeoffs* (per your request). Larger artifacts (hearts, titan scales, etc.) remain impactful and can have tradeoffs.  
- **Bedrock tips:** favor simple queries (on_use, on_equip, tag checks, scoreboard timers) and avoid UI-heavy mechanics. Implement cooldowns with scoreboards/tags and persistent data when necessary.

## Documented trinkets (30; base list + expanded items)
Each entry: Name — Slot / Rarity / Type / Functionality (detailed) / Implementation notes.

1. **Power Glove** — Slot: Ring/Hand / Rarity: Common / Type: Passive  
**Functionality:** +25% knockback applied to mobs when hitting with melee attacks. Visual: small shock particle on hit.  
**Implementation notes:** Check melee attack event; multiply knockback vector. No cooldown; does not stack with other knockback multipliers (cap at +100% global).

**Functionality:** 20% chance when opening a chest to add +1 extra loot item of the same loot table (roll once). Does not affect boss unique loot.  
**Implementation notes:** Hook chest open event; re-roll a single extra item from the chest's loot table and insert if space permits.

3. **Dice (Fortune Die)** — Slot: Trinket / Rarity: Uncommon / Type: Passive  
**Functionality:** 15% chance when killing a mob to duplicate one of its drops (choose random item in the drop list).  
**Implementation notes:** Apply on mob death event; create a duplicate of one of the dropped itemstacks. Mark duplicated drops to avoid recursion or infinite duplication loops.

4. **Shadow Sneak Ring** — Slot: Ring / Rarity: Uncommon / Type: Active-passive (stealth trigger)  
**Functionality:** While sneaking, when you start moving, grant 1.5s invisibility (client & server) with a 6s cooldown. Ideal for brief stealth strikes.

**Functionality:** Heals wearer for 20% of melee damage dealt (rounded to nearest half-heart). Only applies to direct melee hits.  
**Implementation notes:** Apply on damage event; ensure healing doesn’t exceed max health and avoid infinite loops when lifesteal attacks trigger other life effects.

7. **Nether Compass** — Slot: Trinket / Rarity: Common / Type: Passive/Active  
**Functionality:** When equipped, shows basic heading arrow toward the player's last spawn anchor / respawn point in the Nether (client HUD arrow or chat hint). Pressing use toggles HUD on/off.

**Functionality: (Chat GPT)** Grants +10s to breath underwater while equipped and reduces water movement slowdown.  
**Functionality: (Kauziin)** Grants aquatic breathing and slightly increases the wearer's speed while underwater.  
**Implementation notes:** Extend air tick counter by +10 when underwater or apply temporary water-breathing status while equipped.

15. **Depth Locket** — Slot: Pendant / Rarity: Common / Type: Passive (HUD)  
**Functionality:** Shows a small depth readout (Y-level delta from sea level or surface) in HUD while underwater. Toggleable.  
**Implementation notes:** Simple Y-coordinate display; avoid heavy HUD updates—update at low frequency like once per second.  
**Personal notes:** Probably indicating the depth level relative to the surface. I recommend using UI Queue, which allows multiple pieces of information to be displayed on the screen at the same time. Used by: Coldbar Indicator, A Magic Way, Adventure Condiment;  

16. **Fisher's Favor** — Slot: Trinket / Rarity: Uncommon / Type: Passive  
**Functionality:** +12% chance to find "treasure" category items while fishing; slightly shortens average catch time.  
**Implementation notes:** Modify fishing loot roll weights; adjust rod hook timers slightly when equipped.

**Implementation notes:** On block break, search connected blocks (BFS limited to X blocks e.g., 64 nodes) and flag visuals for 2 seconds. Avoid expensive scans—limit radius and nodes.

20. **Auto-Smelt Chip** — Slot: Trinket / Rarity: Uncommon / Type: Passive  
**Functionality:** Converts raw ore drops into smelted items on drop (e.g., iron ore -> iron ingot) when mined. No furnace required. Does not convert blocks (e.g., deepslate ores remain ores).  
**Implementation notes:** Replace drop with smelted result on drop event. Respect silk-touch behavior override if silk-touch-equivalent present.

21. **Silk Glove** — Slot: Glove / Rarity: Rare / Type: Passive (chance)  
**Functionality: (Chat GPT)** 10% chance to drop the block itself instead of the usual drops (silk-touch-like) for compatible blocks (stone, glass, ores when allowed).   
**Functionality: (Kauziin)** Guarantees silk touch on all blocks, including unobtainable ones (like Reinforced Deepslate); It works simultaneously with the tools with fortune, always droping (at least) 2 items. **Rarity change: Legendary**;  
**Implementation notes:** On block break, test randomness and, if passed, drop block item instead of normal drop. Respect special blocks like spawners (avoid breaking balance).  
**Personal notes:** It's better to make it an additional drop rather than a replacement. What's the point of having an occasional silk touch? Not to mention it would work with special blocks. 

22. **Quickstack Token** — Slot: Trinket / Rarity: Common / Type: Active-passive  
**Functionality: (Chat GPT)** When you open a chest, a small auto-sort runs: it moves up to N stacks (configurable; default 8) of identical items from player inventory to chest (one-time per chest open).  
**Functionality: (Kauziin)** Automatically sends all similar items you have in your inventory to the chest when interacting with it using the tool. **Name change: Chest Organizer**, **Slot change: None**, **Type: Active**.   
**Implementation notes:** Implement chest-open hook; move items respecting stack sizes and available slots.

23. **Breaker Bead** — Slot: Bead/Pendant / Rarity: Common / Type: Passive  
**Functionality:** +8% block break speed when using tools; short internal cooldown per tool-swing to avoid abuse.  
**Implementation notes:** Apply small efficiency multiplier; block-break scoring/cooldown per player/tool to avoid automation exploits.

24. **Trail Torch** — Slot: None; Consumable Item / Rarity: Common / Type: Active (place-on-walk)  
**Functionality: (Chat GPT)** When activated, plants temporary torches along the player's path that last for 10 minutes before decaying. Great for cave runs.

**Functionality: (Kauziin)** Adds a distance meter to the HUD for a player-marked location, with a limit of 5 markers. Meant to be used with UI Queue.  
**Implementation notes:** Write to a custom map data structure per-player; minimize UI changes—prefer chat confirmations or subtle map icons.

**Functionality:** Creates an omnidirectional light source around player (radius ~6) in dark areas. Automatically disables in daylight.  
**Implementation notes:** Use dynamic light entity if available; otherwise spawn invisible light block with short lifetime refreshed periodically.

29. **Miner's Pocket** — Slot: Pocket/Belt / Rarity: Uncommon / Type: Passive  
**Functionality: (Chat GPT)** Adds a small extra storage (8 slots) that only accepts mineral/ore items to reduce inventory clutter. Auto-sorts by type.  
**Functionality: (Kauziin)** Creates a bag that automatically collects everything related to ores, with 16 spaces. **Slot change: None; Active Item**.  
**Implementation notes:** Implement as a virtual inventory bound to the trinket; sync with player's inventory on open.
**Personal notes:** GPT Chat is trying to add a slot where it doesn't exist lol.

## Implementation & technical suggestions (Bedrock-focused)
- **Cooldowns & timers:** Use scoreboards or persistent entity tags for cooldown tracking. Keep tick usage minimal.  
- **Performance:** Highlight visual effects only locally when possible. Avoid global scans—limit scans to short radii and small iteration caps.  
- **Loot placement:** For items intended as exploration rewards, place them in structure loot tables or mob drops (use existing add-on examples such as Rings & Relics for inspiration). citeturn0search0  
- **Testing:** Playtest rarities and frequencies in a survival run to ensure minor trinkets feel helpful but non-obligatory.
